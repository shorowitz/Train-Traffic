# ABSTRACT #
New Yorkers rely on the subway to get everywhere and anywhere. They also rely on the MTA Service Status app to inform them whether or not the train they wish to ride is providing regular, good service at that time or if it is experiencing delays. But the MTA app does not give them minute-by-minute information, such as whether a particular stop platform is overly crowded, if riders have been waiting an inordinate amount of time for their train to arrive, if one exit/entrance is blocked off, if "this train is being held by the train's dispatcher," etc. *App Name Here* allows riders to view the MTA Service Status App widget on any page, but to also add comments for a particular stop on a particular line to give other riders a heads up about what is going on there at that time and date.
